### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1.We have most successful projects on May. After May, the successful projects are getting lower and lower.

2.There is no canceled project on Oct. Successful projects and failed projects have the same trend over time.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1.The bigger the goal of crowdfunding,the lower the success rate, when the amount is under 25000.

2.When the amount of the goal is less than 1000, the success rate of projects is the highest.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

1.We can not find the cost of these projects to evaluate the feasibility

2.We can not find the duration of these projects directly in the speadsheet.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1.The line graph showing the relationship between percentage funded and categories.

2.The line graph showing the relationship between backers and time 

3.The line graph showing the relationship between backers and categories.
